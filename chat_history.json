    "A": "21. Introduction\n-A network can be defined as a group of computers and other devices\nconnected in some ways so as to be able to exchange data.\n-Each of the devices on the network can be thought of as a node; each\nnode has a unique address.\n-Addresses are numeric quantities that are easy for computers to work\nwith, but not for humans to remember.\nExample: 204.160.241.98\n-Some networks also provide names that humans can more easily \nremember than numbers.\nExample: www.javasoft.com, corresponding to the above numeric\naddress.\nNICaddr1NICaddrNNICaddr2…\n9Interconnection\n-Networks of low capacity may be connected together via a backbone\nnetwork which is a network of high capacity such as a FDDI network, a\nWAN network etc. \n-LANs and WANs can be interconnected via T1 or T3 digital leased\nlines\n-According to the protocols involved, networks interconnection is\nachieved using one or several of the following devices:→Bridge: a computer or device that links two similar LANs based on \nthe same protocol.\n→Router: a communication computer that connects different types of\nnetworks using different protocols. \n→B-router or Bridge/Router: a single device that combines both the\nfunctions of bridge and router.\n→Gateway: a network device that connects two different systems, using\ndirect and systematic translation between protocols.\n11Network Topology Diagram\nThe specification of the network topology diagram requires the \ndefinition of the characteristics and entities underlying the network:-Geographical locations of the different components or subnets\ninvolved in the network.\n-Description of the LAN topology\n-Description of the WAN topology\n-Description of the network connectors such as routers, bridges,\nrepeaters, and gateways.\n"
